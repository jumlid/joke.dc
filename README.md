Here i'm trying to make a Discord bot via using Discord.js and Nodejs.
About the bot ( i know it's not done yet)
my main focus is to fix my past erros like:
 handle multiples servers 
 handle realtime changes
 lack of database
So i'm thinking of making a proper database using json and instead of rellying on a variable i'll relly on objs with a syntax of server{
                      <Guild_id>:{
                      name:""
                      id:""
                      settings""
                      },..
} 
By  this syntax i  store multiple users on my database  and since i'm storing guild id as a key i don't have to use loop to search for data 
 hehe and since every id are different there won't be any possibility of overwriting hehe 
 This is just my theory T_T IDK how am i gona manage this all let's see :)
